Instructions
Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

The BMI is a measure of some's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

Warning you should convert the result to a whole number.

Example Input
weight = 80
height = 1.75
Example Output
80 รท (1.75 x 1.75) = 26.122448979591837

Hint
Check the data type of the inputs.
Try to use the exponent operator in your code.
Remember PEMDAS.
Remember to convert your result to a whole number (int).
