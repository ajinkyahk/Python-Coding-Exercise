Instructions
Write a program that prints the number of characters in a user's name. You might need to Google for a function that calculates the length of a string.

e.g.

https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+get+the+length+of+a+string+in+python+stack+overflow

Warning. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any name that you input.

Example Input
Angela
Example Output
6
e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happen:

Hint
You can put functions inside other functions.
Don't try to print anything other than the length.
